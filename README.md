# strange-attractors

This is a little webapp I made to allow people to generate and visualise strange attractors in the browser. You can type in the differential equations defining the attractor, apply some calculation settings and then the geometry is generated by scripts running in the browser. The buffers containing the geometry data are passed to WebGL for rendering, so I learned a lot about WebGL while building this.
